### Module 1 Week 2A
#### Probability and Random Variables
- *Probability Theory* - important in linking *Samples* to underlying 
  *Population* of Interest => important for *Statisticsl Inference*.
##### Probability
- Values taken on by the variables are not known until they are observed. 
- Data is composed of observations of underlying *Random Variables*.
- *Probability Theory* provides the mathematics of this randomness.
- **Probability** - fraction of occurrences an event occurs over many 
  repeated trials. 
  - E.g. $\mathbb{P}$
