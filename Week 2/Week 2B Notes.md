#### Continuous Random Variables and the Normal Distribution
##### Random Variables
- A **Continuous Random Variable** can take on any value in an interval
- The probability of any single value is *zero*
- **Probability Density Function (PDF)**
  - The probability of a random variable takes on a value between $a$ and $b$
    - Equal to the area under the *PDF* between $a$ and $b$ (via *Integration*)
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**
  - The probability a random variable will take on a value equal to or less than
  some value.
    - Equal to the area under the CDF to the left of the value of interest.
- **Uniform Distribution (Continuous)**
  - All outcomes are equally likely
  - $X \sim U(a, b)$  
  - **PDF**:

    $$
    \begin{equation} 
      f(x) = \begin{cases} 
        \frac{1}{b - a}, & \text{for $x \in (a, b)$} \\ 
        0, & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation} 
    $$

  - **Mean** $= \frac{1}{2} (a + b)$
  - **Variance** $= \frac{1}{12} (b - a)^2$

- **Normal Distribution**
  - By far, the most well-known and widely used probability distribution
  - Symmetric
  - **Mean** $=$ **Median** $=$ **Mode**
  - $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
  - **PDF**:
    
    $$
    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^{2}}
    $$

  - **Mean** $= \mu$
    - Determines the center.
  - **Variance** $= \sigma^2$
    - Determines the spread.
  - Can be fully characterized by just *Mean* and *Variance*

- **Standard Normal Distribution**
  - Normal distribution of standardized values - for easier comparisons when 
    original *Random Variables* are measured in different units.
  - We can use one distribution, the standard normal distribution, to make
    probability statements about any normally distributed variable.
  - Remember, a variable is standardized by subtracting the mean from each
    value and dividing by the standard deviation. The units of measurement 
    become **Standard Deviations**. For a *Normal Distribution*, these 
    standardized values are called **Z-Scores**.
  - If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$, where:
  - $Z \sim (0,1)$
  - Standardized version $Z$ be used to calculate probabilities associated with 
    any *Normal Random Variable*.
  - **PDF**:

    $$
    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} x^{2}}
    $$

  - **Mean** $= 0$
  - **Variance** $=$ *Standard Deviation* $= 1$
  - The nice properties of the normal distribution facilitate calculating
    probabilities facilitates calculating probabilities. E.g.:
  - Suppose $X \sim N(10, 4)$
  - What is the probability that $X$ is greater than $14$?
    - $\mathbb{P}(X > 14)$
    - Convert to standard normal distribution:
      - $X = 14$ corresponds to $Z = \frac{(14-10)}{2} = 2$
        - $14$ is $2$ *Standard Deviations* *above* the mean of $X$
      - Using a statistical table for the *Standard Normal Distribution* (or a
          computer) we find:
        - The area to the right of $Z = 2 \text{(i.e. to the right of X = 14)} = 0.0228$
  - What is the probability that $X$ is less than $8$?
    - $\mathbb{P}(X < 8)$
    - Convert to standard normal distribution:
      - $X = 8$ corresponds to $Z= \frac{(8-10)}{2} = -1$
        - $8$ is $1$ standard deviation *below* the mean of $X$
      - Using a statistical table for the standard normal distribution (or a
          computer) we find:
        - The area to the left of $Z = -1 \text{(i.e. to the left of X = 8)} = 0.1587$
  - What is the probability that $X$ is in between $8$ and $14$?
    - $\mathbb{P}(8 < X < 14)$
      - The area in between $Z$-scores $-1$ and 2 = 1 â€“ (0.0228 + 0.1587) = 0.8185$
