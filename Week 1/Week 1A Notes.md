#### Introduction
- **Data Analytics** - using data to inform decisions.
- **Statistics** - calculations derived from a dataset used to convey 
  important features of the data in a concise way; the science focused on 
  collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.
- Statistics can be used on both accurate/non-accurate data, and approriate 
  *and* inappropriate techniques can be used; see **Stamp's Law** as a 
  reminder to be cautious and critical when interpreting data.
- **Stamp's Law** - “The government are very keen on amassing statistics. They collect them, add
them, raise them to the nth power, take the cube root and prepare wonderful
diagrams. But you must never forget that every one of these figures comes in
the first instance from the village watchman, who just puts down what he
damn pleases.” -- Josiah Stamp, 1st Baron Stamp
  - **GIGO** - Garbage In - Garbage Out
- 2 Main Branches of Statistics:
  - **Descriptive Statistics** - describe the characteristics of a 
    *particular dataset
    - e.g. average amount of debt held by 100 U.S. 
      college students
  - **Inferential Statistics** - uses a *sample* of data to draw conclusions 
    about and underlying *population* of interest.
    - e.g. using the sample of 100 U.S. college students to draw conclusions 
      about all college students in the U.S.
