### Module 1 Week 1B: Descriptive Statistics
#### Descriptive Statistics
- *Descriptive Statistics*:
  - Describe the characteristics of a dataset
  - Can involve a single variable; e.g. average student debt.
  - Can involve multiple variables; e.g. correlation between average student 
    debt and the GPA involves two variables. 
  - Can be numerical, graphical, tabular.
  - Help a researcher know the data to know how to analyze it; otherwise, 
    hard to navigate large sets of numbers, but key numerical 
    measures/graphs are more insightful.
- *Bar Chart*:
  - Helpful for categorical data.
  - Categories typically on the x-axis; outcomes of interest -- on the y-axis.
  - Sometimes y-axis measures the relative frequency of the categories.
- *Histogram*:
  - Adjoins intervals (boxes or bins) along the x-axis.
  - Relative frequency of the values within each interval on the y-axis.
  - If $f = \text{frequency a values occurs}$; $n = \text{sample size}$; 
    then $\frac{f}{n} = \text{relative frequency}$.
