### Module 1 Week 1B: Descriptive Statistics
#### Descriptive Statistics
- *Descriptive Statistics*:
  - Describe the characteristics of a dataset
  - Can involve a single variable; e.g. average student debt.
  - Can involve multiple variables; e.g. correlation between average student 
    debt and the GPA involves two variables. 
  - Can be numerical, graphical, tabular.
  - Help a researcher know the data to know how to analyze it; otherwise, 
    hard to navigate large sets of numbers, but key numerical 
    measures/graphs are more insightful.
- *Bar Chart*:
  - Helpful for categorical data.
  - Categories typically on the x-axis; outcomes of interest -- on the y-axis.
  - Sometimes y-axis measures the relative frequency of the categories.
- *Histogram*:
  - Adjoins intervals (boxes or bins) along the x-axis.
    - Tradeoff between clarity and precision: more bars is higher precision, 
      but potentially worse clarity and vice versa.
  - Relative frequency (number of times a value occurs out of all data points)
    of the values within each interval on the y-axis.
  - If $f = \text{frequency a values occurs}$; $n = \text{sample size}$; 
    then $\frac{f}{n} = \text{relative frequency}$. 
- *Time Series Graph (Line Graph)*:
  - Helpful to see how a variable behaves over time.
  - Time is typically along the x-axis.
  - Variable of interest is typically along the y-axis.
  - Can also do a split between multiple categories; e.g. unemployment rate 
    across time between Alabama vs. Maryland.
  - Saint-Louis Federal Reserve's FRED Data Base has many data good for 
    time-series analysis.
- *Measures of Location* - used to get a sense of a typical value for a 
  variable:
  - *Percentiles*:
    - Find value $i$ which corresponds to the $k$'th percentile: i = \frac{k}{100} (n+1)$
    - E.g. 50th percentile value for 101 observations: $i = \frac{50}{100} (101+1)$
